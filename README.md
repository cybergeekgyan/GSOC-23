### How to Get Started?
Here are a few pointers on how to get started —

 - If you are sure the organization you want to contribute to will most likely participate in GSoC that year, you can start early and contact their mentors without waiting.
 - Doing thorough research on organizations that offer projects under your domain of interest in advance helps speed up the process once the list is out.

### Choosing the Right Project




### Email! Email! Email!

Once You have decided your projects, Sit down and write emails to the mentors

Keep Emailing all the project mentors you've selected back and forth, and once you got the hang of the projects, started working on your proposals.



*Things to keep in mind —*

 - Mentors have a lot on their plate too, so getting a reply from them might take days, so I’d suggest starting as early as you can.
 - Not all mentors prefer email, so read the code of conduct on the GSoC website and contact them accordingly.
 - Make a good first impression, DO NOT contact them without research, state all the relevant work you have done previously, and make them feel that you know the project.
 
 
 
 ### Writing the Proposals
 
 This step is definitely the most crucial step in the application process. 
 
 To write the perfect proposal —
  
  - Seek help from former GSoCers and ask them to share their proposals.
  - Use visuals in your proposal.
  - Use a clean and professional template.
  - Add stuff about you apart from your previous experiences. Eg. your time zones, your working hours, your preferred communication medium, etc.
  - Write steps that will convince the mentors and reviewers that you won't slack during the course of the project.
  - Most Important — DELIVERABLES
  - Get your drafts reviewed by your mentors and seniors.

### The Wait

Once the proposals are in, an important part is keep following up to the mentors by working on the project.
  - Pitch in some ideas.
  - Clone the repos and tinker the code.
  - Get familiarised with the project interface.
  - Ask for articles you could read about the project.
*All these really cast a good impression on the mentor and the organization and help push you as the best candidate for the job!*
